## COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Classification
To understand the importance of the features learnt while performing transfer learning in case of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), I selected the problem of classification of Chest X-Rays into COVID-19 positive and negative. I intend to perform bit plane slicing and provide these bit planes separately as input to the DCNNs for transfer learning.

## Dataset
The dataset used for the study can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/csc532)
